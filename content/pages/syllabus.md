Course Overview
---------------

Women have made significant progress over the course of history in achieving greater equity in the domestic sphere and in the workplace, but they still earn less on average than men and are underrepresented in multiple industries and senior positions. What is holding women back from more progress? How would we all benefit from a more gender-equitable society? This course will provide students with an analytic framework to understand the mechanisms that generate gaps in gender equality in positions of power and leadership, and explore interventions to close these gaps. In particular, we will study:

*   The consequences of gender inequality for companies and for economic performance.
*   The current landscape of female participation in different sectors in the U.S., paying special attention to leadership positions within the corporate, academic, political and non-profit sectors.
*   The root causes of gender inequality in positions of power, leadership and the workplace.
*   Interventions and policies that address the structural barriers that contribute to create a gender gap such as affirmative action, parental leave, and child-care policies.
*   The role of bias and stereotypes in preventing gender diversity and what can be done to manage these effects.
